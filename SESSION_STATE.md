# Session State - October 25, 2025

## Current Status
**Multi-station execution interface implemented and working!**

## What Was Completed This Session

### 1. Multi-Station Execution Interface Implementation ✅
**Problem**: Multiple workers needed to execute the same kitting job simultaneously from different stations/tablets without interfering with each other's progress.

**Solution**: Implemented atomic station assignment system with independent kit tracking per station.

**Database Schema Changes**:
- Added `next_station_number` to `job_progress` table (atomic counter)
- Added `station_number` and `station_name` to `kit_executions` table
- Migration file: `prisma/migrations/20251025_add_station_tracking.sql`

**Backend Implementation** (`server/index.cjs`):
- `POST /api/job-progress/:id/assign-station` - Atomically assigns unique station numbers
- `POST /api/job-progress/:id/release-station` - Decrements counter when EI closed
- `POST /api/job-progress/reset-all-stations` - Admin endpoint to reset counters
- Uses Prisma's atomic `increment`/`decrement` for race-condition safety

**Frontend Implementation** (`src/pages/JobExecute.tsx`):
- Automatic station assignment on page load using `useRef` to prevent duplicates
- Changed `currentKitExecutionId` from `useState` to `useRef` for synchronous updates (CRITICAL FIX)
- Added `hasAutoStarted` ref to prevent infinite render loops
- Two separate useEffect hooks: station assignment → re-render → kit start
- Independent kit tracking per station (Station 1: kit 1, Station 2: kit 2, etc.)
- Polling mechanism syncs completed kits count across all stations every 2 seconds
- Station cleanup on window close using `beforeunload` event

### 2. Consolidated BASIC Execution Interface UI ✅
**User Request**: Streamline the BASIC interface by consolidating cards and maximizing button

**Changes** (`src/components/BasicExecutionView.tsx`):
- Consolidated header into single card with 4-column grid:
  - Column 1: Job # / Customer Name
  - Column 2: Time Remaining (with overdue indicator)
  - Column 3: Station # (with icon)
  - Column 4: Kit Counter (total + station-specific)
- Removed separate "Time Remaining" card
- Maximized "NEXT KIT" button to fill remaining vertical space
- Performance status indicators (AHEAD/ON_TRACK/BEHIND)
- Gradient background for better visual appeal

**Loading Screen Update**:
- Matches the same 4-column card layout as the active execution view
- Shows job info, time remaining, station assignment status, and kit progress
- Centered loading message with pulsing checkmark

## Files Modified This Session

1. **prisma/schema.prisma**
   - Added `nextStationNumber` field to `JobProgress` model

   - Split station assignment and kit start into two effects (lines 188-236)
   - Added station tracking state and refs (lines 37-43)
   - Station release on window close (lines 238-251)
   - Multi-station progress polling (lines 253-288)
   - Updated loading screen with consolidated card layout (lines 925-980)

5. **src/components/BasicExecutionView.tsx**
   - Consolidated header card layout (lines 52-101)
   - Maximized button to fill vertical space (lines 104-135)
   - Added station name prop and display

6. **reset-stations.sql**
   - Helper SQL script to reset all station counters to 0

7. **CLAUDE.md**
   - Added comprehensive documentation for multi-station implementation
   - Known issues section
   - Database migration SQL

## Known Issues / Future Work

### Station Number Display on Loading Screen
**Issue**: Station number doesn't display immediately when page loads - only appears after kit starts
- Root cause: React state timing issue between station assignment and kit start
- Station is assigned and stored in state, but loading screen renders before state updates
- Need to investigate forcing re-render after station assignment completes
- Workaround: Station shows correctly once kit starts

### Station Release on Browser Crash
**Issue**: If browser crashes or loses power, station number not released
- `beforeunload` event only fires on clean exit
- Could lead to station counter growing without bound
- Potential solution: Timeout-based station release on server side

## How to Resume Next Session

1. **Start dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test multi-station functionality**:
   - Open job in multiple browser tabs/windows
   - Each should get assigned unique station number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Verify each station can complete kits independently
   - Verify kit counter syncs across all stations
   - Close one tab and verify station counter decrements

3. **Deploy to production** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # LOCAL: Build and push
   docker build -t motionalysis/kittrix:latest .
   docker push motionalysis/kittrix:latest

   # SERVER: Pull and restart
   ssh sean@137.184.182.28
   cd ~/KitTrix-Express
   git pull
   docker-compose pull
   docker-compose up -d

   # Run migration on production database
   psql postgresql://motioadmin:M0t10n4lys1s@172.17.0.1:5432/motioPGDB
   \i prisma/migrations/20251025_add_station_tracking.sql
   ```

## Database Connection Details
- Production DB: `postgresql://motioadmin:M0t10n4lys1s@172.17.0.1:5432/motioPGDB`
- Local tunnel: `ssh -L 5433:172.17.0.1:5432 sean@137.184.182.28 -N &`
- Local connection: `postgresql://motioadmin:M0t10n4lys1s@localhost:5433/motioPGDB`

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why useRef for currentKitExecutionId?
- React state updates asynchronously
- When `completeKit()` called immediately after `startNewKit()`, state was still null
- useRef provides synchronous updates, value available immediately
- Critical for preventing "Kit execution ID missing" errors

### Why Two Separate useEffect Hooks?
- First effect: Assigns station and updates state
- React re-renders component with new state
- Second effect: Waits for station state to be set, then starts kit
- This ensures loading screen CAN display station (though timing still imperfect)

### Why Polling Instead of WebSockets?
- Simpler implementation
- Good enough for 2-second latency requirement
- No server-side socket infrastructure needed
- Can upgrade to WebSockets later if needed

## Success Criteria

✅ Multiple stations can work on same job simultaneously
✅ Each station gets unique number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
✅ Stations don't interfere with each other's kit tracking
✅ Global kit counter updates across all stations
✅ Station numbers release when tab/window closed
✅ UI consolidated into single card layout
✅ Button maximized for easy touch interaction
✅ Kit execution uses refs to prevent timing bugs
✅ No infinite render loops

## Post-Deployment Testing (October 26, 2025)

### Issue Encountered
- Initial deployment showed "Failed to complete kit" error in production
- Local testing showed "Job not found" error initially

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **SSH Tunnel Not Running**: SSH tunnel to database (port 5433) was down, preventing local development from accessing production database
2. **Jobs Still Exist**: All 21 test jobs were intact in production database
3. **API Working**: Backend API was functioning correctly when tested via curl
4. **Frontend Connection**: Issue was frontend not connecting to backend, resolved by restarting SSH tunnel

### Resolution Steps
1. Started SSH tunnel: `ssh -L 5433:172.17.0.1:5432 sean@137.184.182.28 -N &`
2. Verified database connectivity and jobs exist
3. Added enhanced error logging to completeKit() for future debugging
4. Tested locally - all functionality working
5. Deployed to production with enhanced logging

### Enhanced Error Logging Added
- Detailed error messages in completeKit() catch block
- Logs: error message, stack trace, currentKitExecutionId, jobProgressId, currentKit
- Alert shows specific error instead of generic message
- Helps diagnose multi-station kit completion issues

## Next Session Priorities

1. Fix station number display on loading screen (high priority)
2. Test multi-station functionality with multiple browser tabs/devices
3. Implement timeout-based station release on server
4. Test multi-station with multiple physical tablets
5. Add station management UI for admins
6. Consider adding station names (not just numbers)
