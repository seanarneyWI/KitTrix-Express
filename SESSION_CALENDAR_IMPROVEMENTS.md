# Calendar View & Filtering Improvements - October 30, 2025

## Summary
Implemented full-screen calendar views with an advanced job filtering system, increasing usable screen space from ~33% to ~95% and providing powerful search and visibility controls.

## Problem Statement
The user reported difficulty finding specific jobs (e.g., job 2501) on the calendar because:
1. Calendar views only used about 2/3rds of screen width and 1/2 of vertical space
2. No filtering or search capabilities existed
3. All jobs were always visible, causing clutter

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Full-Screen Layout (Screen Real Estate Optimization)

#### App.tsx Changes
- Added conditional layout based on route using `useLocation` hook
- Dashboard route gets full width (`w-full`)
- Other pages maintain container constraints for readability

#### Calendar Component Updates
All three calendar views (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) were updated:
- **Removed**: `max-w-7xl mx-auto` width constraints
- **Added**: `w-full h-full flex flex-col` for full space utilization
- **Result**: Calendars now use ~95% of available screen space

**Before**: Calendars centered with fixed max-width of 1280px
**After**: Calendars expand to fill entire viewport width

### 2. Job Filter Panel (Advanced Filtering System)

Created a modern slide-out sidebar panel (`JobFilterPanel.tsx` - 350+ lines):

#### Features
- **Search**: Real-time filtering by job number, customer name, or description
- **Status Filters**: Multi-select toggles for SCHEDULED, IN_PROGRESS, PAUSED, COMPLETED
- **Individual Visibility**: Checkbox for each job to show/hide on calendar
- **Group By**: Organize jobs by Customer, Status, or None
- **Quick Actions**:
  - ☑ All: Show all filtered jobs
  - ☐ None: Hide all jobs
  - ↻ Reset: Restore default filters
- **Jump to Job**: Click any job card to navigate to its date in daily view
- **Persistent State**: Preferences saved to localStorage
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press Escape to close panel

#### UI/UX Design
- Slide-out animation (250ms smooth transition)
- Backdrop overlay with click-to-close
- Sticky header and footer for constant access to controls
- Scrollable job list in center
- Badge indicator showing hidden job count on trigger button

### 3. Density Mode Controls

Three density levels for all calendar views:

#### Monthly Calendar
| Mode | Cell Height | Events Shown |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Compact | 80px | 2 events + more indicator |
| Normal | 120px | 3 events + more indicator |
| Comfortable | 160px | All events (no limit) |

#### Weekly Calendar
| Mode | Time Slot Height |
|------|-----------------|
| Compact | 32px (h-8) |
| Normal | 48px (h-12) |
| Comfortable | 64px (h-16) |

#### Daily Calendar
| Mode | Time Slot Height |
|------|-----------------|
| Compact | 40px (h-10) |
| Normal | 64px (h-16) |
| Comfortable | 80px (h-20) |

**Dynamic Calculations**: All event positioning automatically adjusts based on selected density mode.

### 4. State Management (`useJobFilters` Hook)

Created a custom React hook (`useJobFilters.ts` - 180 lines) to centralize filter logic:

#### Responsibilities
- Manages visibility state for all jobs
- Handles search query filtering
- Controls status filter selections
- Manages density mode preference
- Persists state to localStorage
- Automatically handles new jobs added to the system

#### API
```typescript
const jobFilters = useJobFilters(kittingJobs);

// State
jobFilters.visibleJobs        // Jobs to display on calendar
jobFilters.filteredJobs        // Jobs matching search/status filters
jobFilters.searchQuery         // Current search text
jobFilters.statusFilters       // Set of active status filters
jobFilters.densityMode         // Current density setting
jobFilters.hiddenJobCount      // Number of hidden jobs

// Actions
jobFilters.toggleJobVisibility(jobId)
jobFilters.setSearchQuery(query)
jobFilters.toggleStatusFilter(status)
jobFilters.setDensityMode(mode)
jobFilters.selectAll()
jobFilters.deselectAll()
jobFilters.resetFilters()

// Checks
jobFilters.isJobVisible(jobId)
jobFilters.isStatusFilterActive(status)
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dashboard Integration
```typescript
// Initialize filter hook
const jobFilters = useJobFilters(kittingJobs);

// Use filtered jobs in calendar
const allCalendarItems = [
  ...events,
  ...jobFilters.visibleJobs.flatMap(kittingJobToEvents)
];

// Pass density mode to all calendar views
<MonthlyCalendar
  densityMode={jobFilters.densityMode}
  {...otherProps}
/>
```

### Filter Panel State Management
- Uses React Sets for efficient lookup of visible job IDs
- Calculates `visibleJobs` by filtering `filteredJobs` against `visibleJobIds` Set
- Auto-syncs new jobs into visibility set
- Persists to localStorage on every filter change

### Bug Fixes During Implementation

#### Issue: All/None Buttons Not Working
**Problem**: Empty `visibleJobIds` Set was interpreted as "show all" instead of "show none"

**Solution**:
1. Changed initialization to populate Set with all job IDs by default
2. Removed special case logic that showed all jobs when Set was empty
3. Now empty Set correctly means "hide all jobs"

**Before**:
```typescript
if (filters.visibleJobIds.size === 0) {
  return filteredJobs; // Wrong! Shows all when empty
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
return filteredJobs.filter(job => filters.visibleJobIds.has(job.id));
// Empty Set = no jobs match = correct behavior
```

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `src/App.tsx` - Conditional full-screen layout for Dashboard
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Integrated filter panel, added filter button
- `src/components/MonthlyCalendar.tsx` - Full-width layout + density support
- `src/components/WeeklyCalendar.tsx` - Full-width layout + density support
- `src/components/DailyCalendar.tsx` - Full-height layout + density support

### Created
- `src/components/JobFilterPanel.tsx` - Complete filter UI (350+ lines)
- `src/hooks/useJobFilters.ts` - Filter state management (180 lines)

## Statistics

- **Lines Added**: 734
- **Lines Modified**: 78
- **New Components**: 2
- **Screen Space Improvement**: From ~33% to ~95% utilization
- **Commit Hash**: 5edbee4e

## User Impact

### Before
- Calendar views were small and centered
- No way to search or filter jobs
- All jobs always visible causing visual clutter
- Fixed event limits per day
- No control over information density

### After
- Calendar views utilize nearly entire screen
- Powerful search across multiple fields
- Granular control over job visibility
- Adjustable information density
- Preferences persist across sessions
- Quick navigation to job dates
- Visual indicator of hidden jobs

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add Cmd/Ctrl+F to open filter panel
2. **Saved Filter Presets**: Allow saving common filter combinations
3. **Export Visible Jobs**: Export filtered job list to CSV/Excel
4. **Bulk Actions**: Multi-select jobs for batch operations
5. **Filter by Date Range**: Show only jobs within specific dates
6. **Color Coding**: Custom colors for different job types
7. **Drag to Reorder**: Allow manual job priority sorting in filter panel

## Testing Recommendations

- [ ] Test All/None buttons with various filter combinations
- [ ] Verify search works across job number, customer, description
- [ ] Confirm status filters correctly hide/show jobs
- [ ] Check density modes resize correctly in all three views
- [ ] Validate localStorage persistence after page reload
- [ ] Test jump-to-job navigation functionality
- [ ] Verify new jobs automatically appear in filter list
- [ ] Check filter panel closes on Escape key
- [ ] Test with many jobs (50+) for performance

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No database migrations required
- No API changes needed
- Filter preferences stored client-side only
- Mobile responsiveness not yet addressed (future work)
